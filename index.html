            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Miriam Hidalgo and I am an avid web developer. I originally come from the world of social services. I have spent much of my career helping others in any way that I can. In my current job, the demogrographic I currently serve is the senior citizen population. I am involved with creating new ways to engage seniors to participate in activities. My favorite part of the day is when I create alluring flyers, email blasts, keep office flow bustling by manipulating data in spreadsheets. All of these resposiblities have led me to realize web development allows for all these skills to be illustrated in a more impactful way. I learned that I can channel my creative energies of design and data into coding. Please feel free to browse and check out some of my projects!</p>
