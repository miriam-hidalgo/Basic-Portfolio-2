<!--
The content for the `index.html` should be unique to **you**.

   * Write a paragraph or two about yourself. Make it fun, show your personality!
   * The main logo where it says "Your Name" should say your name. This may make the logo section smaller or wider depending on how long your name isâ€”that is fine and expected.
   * Add, commit, and push your code to GitHub often, especially when you complete a page.

Profile Image Found on `index.html`:
   * Use a picture of yourself.
   * If you don't have a picture, you can grab a placeholder image from [LoremPixel](http://lorempixel.com/). Save the images to your `images` folder.

### Bonus

1. Make your pages more sophisticated by adding style to text links, to image links, and to buttons for when a user hovers their cursor over them. A CSS hover tutorial can be found [here](http://www.codeitpretty.com/2013/06/how-to-use-css-hover-effects.html).

2. You can use [Adobe Kuler](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/) to find colors that match the theme (in this case, the primary color is Teal `#4aaaa5`).

3. Make a "sticky footer." You will notice the dark grey footer will always rest just below the content. This is fine whenever your site has enough content to push it down past the height of most monitors. But if there isn't much content in the body, the footer could rest in the middle of the page:
   * Try to code the footer in a way that it will always remain at the bottom of the page, no matter how short the content is. A sticky footer tutorial can be found [here](https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/).

        <p>Welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Miriam Hidalgo and I am an avid web developer. I originally come from the world of social services. I have spent much of my career helping others in any way that I can. In my current job, the demogrographic I currently serve is the senior citizen population. I am involved with creating new ways to engage seniors to participate in activities. My favorite part of the day is when I create alluring flyers, email blasts, keep office flow bustling by manipulating data in spreadsheets. All of these resposiblities have led me to realize web development allows for all these skills to be illustrated in a more impactful way. I learned that I can channel my creative energies of design and data into coding. Please feel free to browse and check out some of my projects!</p>
